# Hello GeeksðŸ‘‹!


I'm Mayuresh Naidu, a curious coder and UX enthusiast with a passion for building user-centered applications. With a background in computer science and self-taught UX design, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and functionality. Currently sharpening my skills in web development at <a href="https://mediaarts.humber.ca/programs/web-development.html">Humber Polytechnic</a>, I love turning ideas into reality through clean code and intuitive design. When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m exploring new tech, solving problems, or brainstorming my next project. Letâ€™s build something awesome together! ðŸš€
